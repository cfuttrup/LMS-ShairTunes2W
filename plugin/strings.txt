PLUGIN_SHAIRTUNES2_HTTPLATENCY
	EN	HTTP latency
	
PLUGIN_SHAIRTUNES2_LATENCY_DESC
	EN	Use to tweak buffering realtime bridge buffering. AirPlay frames are received using UDP (realtime RTP) and 
	EN	are forwarded to SB using HTTP. When two received UDP frames are not consecutives, the in-between missing 
	EN	ones are requested again but HTTP sending must be put on hold while waiting for these.
	EN	SB players must also have enough frames buffered to ensure uninterrupted playback. It seems that the "Buffer Level"
	EN	parameter above is not working well, so it's also possible to force the bridge to build a big enough buffer before
	EN	requesting LMS to play, so that SB players will receive a large amount of larger burst frames at startup
	EN	<br>- RTP: max holding time (ms) of HTTP sending when missing UDP frames
	EN	<br>- HTTP: delay before playback command is sent to LMS after first AirPlay frame has been received 
	
PLUGIN_SHAIRTUNES2_ENCODE
	EN	Encoding parameters
	
PLUGIN_SHAIRTUNES2_ENCODE_DESC
	EN	Audio received from AirPlay devices are coded using ALAC, which cannot be streamed directly to LMS players.
	EN	It can be re-encoded in pcm, flac or mp3. With flac, the compression level can be adjusted from 0 to 9
	EN	(default = 0, gives lowest compression, least CPU consumption). With mp3 the bitrate must bet set (default = 128)

PLUGIN_SHAIRTUNES2_DRIFT
	EN	Let timing references drift
	
PLUGIN_SHAIRTUNES2_DRIFT_DESC
	EN	AirPlay and LMS timing references are asynchronous and, on a long term, their differences can create
	EN	buffer underrun or overrun (producing too much or not enough samples). This is corrected by forcing
	EN	the addition or deletion of a 8 ms buffer when needed, but such adjustement creates a "click". Disable 
	EN	this option avoid it but let references drift.
