This is a fork from https://github.com/disaster123/shairport2_plugin with the following changes
- works under Windows as well
- has a build-in mDNS server (the part below related to avahi does not appli anymore, or at least is not needed)
- allows audio to be sent to LMS sync'd players 
- caches artwork for LMS < 7.8 as well
- does not require (normally) any extra installation of Perl addons 

Needed packages to rebuild:
