- allows audio to be sent to LMS sync'd players 
- caches artwork for LMS < 7.8 as well
- does not require (normally) any extra installation of Perl addons 

Packaged versions can be found here https://sourceforge.net/projects/lms-plugins-philippe44/ and here https://sourceforge.net/projects/lms-shairtunes2/files/dev/
